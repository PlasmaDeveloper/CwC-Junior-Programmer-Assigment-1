# CwC-Junior-Programmer-Assigment-1
First Unity Junior Programmer Assigment, that uses GitHub

This was made with the basefiles for this assigment from the Unity Junior Programmer Pathway on Unity learn.
It is only a MVP and could use some bugfixing and polishing, but it seems enough for the Pathway requirements.
